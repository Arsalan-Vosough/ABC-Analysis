# ABC-Analysis
In this code, I provide ABC analysis. ABC analysis is a method in which inventory is divided into three categories.
The items in the A category have the highest value, B category items are of lower value than A, and C category items have the lowest value.
ABC inventory analysis is based on the Pareto Principle. The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the sales volume is generated from the top 20% of the items.
It means that the top 20% of the items will generate 80% of the revenue for the business. 
It is also known as the 80/20 rule.
